h1. Git presentation

This is the slides and commandline history from a short introduction/demo of Git that I held at Javaforum Gothenburg, 2010-06-17.

The text files contains the commandline buffers that I used during the demos.
* main_developer.txt - This is where I created the initial repository and pushed it to the "central" repository
* server.txt - Creating the "central" repository
* second_developer.txt - Cloned the "central" repository here.
